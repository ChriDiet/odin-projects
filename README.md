I'm making this website to practice the skills I learn through The Odin Project. 

My Odin projects will be collected on this site, hopefully the index page will look better and better as I make my way through the curriculum! I'm also hoping to update my projects along the way. The "original" project submisson will stay untouched so I can see how far I've come.
